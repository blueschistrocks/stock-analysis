# Stock Analysis Challenge 

## Overview of Project

Steve (Client) has requested an analysis of multiple stocks over 2017 and 2018 and would like to have the Visual Basic (VBA) module that was previously submitted optimized to complete the analysis of thousands of stocks efficiently.

## Refactoring the Code

The original VBA module was refactored by creating a ticker Index, three output arrays for volumes, starting prices and ending prices.  The Ticker Index was created and set to zero. The Ticker Index will allow each ticker in the ticker array to be accessed by three output arrays. Each output array was set to 12 to indicate the number of elements in the arrays to match the number of elements is in the ticker array. Setting up the output arrays in this way will allow the code to loop through the data for each ticker to retrieve the volume, starting and ending prices more efficiently, therefore excluding the need for a nested loop.  A For Loop was created to initialize the ticker Volumes to zero. A non-nested for loop was created to loop through the data worksheet. Iterations were set to loop from the first row of data through the last row of data.  The loop evaluates the retrieves total volume for the current ticker and then the loop retrieves the start price and ending price of the current ticker second then lastly the loop increases the tickerIndex by one. This loop will continue until all twelve tickers have been looped through.

## Results 

The refactored code run the analysis in approximately Â¼ of a second where the original code run the analysis in about 1 second, significantly faster than the original code.  This is due to the code requiring a nested For Loop and using the three output arrays. 

## Advantages of Refactoring

The advantage of refactoring the was making the code significantly faster, which will make the code more efficient when analyzing a larger number of stocks.  Another advantage is make the code cleaner and more readable. Personally, I found the advantage of refactoring was being able to better understand how the code works by reworking the code.

## Disadvantages of Refactoring

There really are no disadvantages in refactoring the code for the client, with the exception of paying to do the refactoring, however the cost would likely be offset by the more efficient code.  I did find it difficult to do at first to do the refactoring, so it could be a disadvantage for an analysis that does not have syntax experience with VBA to do the refactoring.
