# Stock Analysis Challenge 

## Overview of Project

Steve (Client) has requested an analysis of multiple stocks over 2017 and 2018 and would like to have the Visual Basic (VBA) module that was previously submitted optimized to complete the analysis of thousands of stocks efficiently.

## Refactoring the Code

The original VBA module was refactored by creating a ticker Index, three output arrays for volumes, starting prices and ending prices.  The Ticker Index was created and set to zero. The Ticker Index will allow each ticker in the ticker array to be accessed by three output arrays. Each output array was set to 12 to indicate the number of elements in the arrays to match the number of elements is in the ticker array. Setting up the output arrays in this way will allow the code to loop through the data for each ticker to retrieve the volume, starting and ending prices more efficiently, therefore excluding the need for a nested loop.  A For Loop was created to initialize the ticker Volumes to zero. A non-nested for loop was created to loop through the data worksheet. Iterations were set to loop from the first row of data through the last row of data.  The loop retrieves total volume for the current ticker and then retrieves the start price and ending price of the current ticker then lastly the loop increases the tickerIndex by one. This loop will continue until all twelve tickers have been looped through.

## Results 

The refactored code ran the analysis in approximately Â¼ of a second where the original code ran the analysis in about 1 second, significantly faster than the original code.  This is due to the refactored code not requiring a nested For Loop and using the three output arrays. 

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

### Advantages

I found that the main advantage of refactoring a code is being able to better understand how the code works by reviewing the code and finding ways to reorgnize it. Refactoring any code may lead to new ideas on how to approach analyzing data. 

### Disadvantages

There really are no disadvantages in refactoring code for a client with the exception of paying someone to do the refactoring, however the cost would likely be offset by the more efficient code.  I did find it difficult at first to do the refactoring, so it could be a disadvantage for an analysis that does not have syntax experience with VBA to do the refactoring efficently.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of the Original VS the Refoactored VBA Code

### Advantages

The advantage of refactoring the original code was making the code significantly faster, which will make the code more efficient when analyzing a larger number of stocks.  Another advantage was making the code cleaner and more readable for someone reviewing or trying to understand how the VBA code works.

### Disadvantages
A disadvantage of refactoring the original VBA is that the original VBA code works well. Unless a client routinely needs to analyze thousands of stocks a VBA code that already works well for a smaller analysis could be more efficient than spending the time to refactor the code.
